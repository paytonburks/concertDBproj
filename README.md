# Concert Database Application
A sample concert database project for a database management course

It is a basic implementation of a web-based application using Gonzaga's barney server. It can be accessed using the link https://barney.gonzaga.edu/~pburks/Final/proj.php.

You can view the most recent entries and most active users from the home page. Additionally, you can search by artist, venue, or user to find data corresponding to your respective search. Also implemented is a way to input new records. A link called 'Interesting Queries' will take you to the four interesting queries I have created.
